A simple program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight.

### Dice Rolling Game
A fun game where users can roll a pair of dice and see the result.

### Enhanced Tip Calculator
An advanced tip calculator that not only calculates the tip but also splits the bill among a group of people.

### Name Generator
A program that generates random names based on user-defined criteria.

### PyPizza Delivery
A program to simulate a pizza delivery system, complete with order management and delivery tracking.

### Rollercoaster
A simulation of a rollercoaster ride with various parameters and user interactions.

### Adventure Game
An adventure game where users navigate through a series of choices to find a hidden treasure.

### Password Generator
A tool that generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and character types.

### QR Code Generator
A program to create QR codes from user input, which can be used for links, text, or any other data.

## Installation

To run these projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
4. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\env\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source env/bin/activate
      ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project has its own directory. To run a project, navigate to its directory and execute the main script. For example:

```bash
cd BMI_Calculator
python main.py
